# 各种会议名称的区别：Symposium, Conference, Seminar, Workshop and Congress

在参加学术会议时可以看到有许多类型的”分会“，而我们投稿论文往往也是针对于某个分会进行的，初看到这些名字难免会感到莫名其妙。在调查这个问题时，我看到在Research Gate上一位学者的回答感觉解释的很清楚[^1]。这里引用如下：

> **A Symposium** is a formal gathering in an academic setting where participants are experts in their fields. These experts present or deliver their opinions or viewpoints on a chosen topic of discussion. It would be correct to label a symposium as a small scale conference as the number of delegates is smaller. There are the usual discussions on the chosen topic after the experts have presented their speeches. The chief characteristic of a symposium is that it covers a single topic or subject and all the lectures given by experts are completed in a single day. A Symposium - prestigious conferences, generally leading venues in their respective fields. 
>
> **A Conference** refers to a formal meeting where participants exchange their views on various topics. Conference can take place in different fields, and it need not be academic in nature all the time. Thus, we have parent teacher conferences, sport conferences, a trade conference, a conference of journalists, conference of doctors, a conference of research scholars, and so on. A conference is a meeting that has been prearranged and involves consultation and discussion on a number of topics by the delegates. Conference and symposium are similar events where speakers come together and give their opinions on a chosen subject. Symposium can be described as a smaller conference that gets over in a single day with a lesser number of delegates.
>
> **A Seminar** is a form of academic instruction, either at a university or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to actively participate. The Instructor has prepared the concepts and techniques they will present and discuss through a combination of visual materials, interactive tools or equipment, and demonstrations. It includes some take home material for the participants that relates to the lecture. A full laboratory phase is not a requirement.
>
> **A Workshop** includes all the elements of the Seminar, but with the largest portion being emphasized on “hand-on-practice” or laboratory work. The Lab work is designed to reinforce, imprint and bring forward an immediate functioning dimension to the participant’s eye and hands by implementing and practicing the actual concept or technique that was taught through the lecture and demonstration process. 
>
> **A Congress** - would typically be held once a year per discipline, highlighting the achievements, notable results in that field. These are typically attended by leaders in that field, and feature a series of invited talks
