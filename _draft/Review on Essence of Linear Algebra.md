# Review on Essence of Linear Algebra

To get geometric understanding of matrices.  Pay more attention to cenceptual half rather than the computation half. 

**Pause and ponder if necessary.**

## Vectors, what even are they?

- Physics : arrow in space
- CS : lists of numbers
- Mathematics : generalize the above two. **Vectors can be anything that make adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number a sensible notion.**

Hence, the two significant operations in linear algebra is vector addition and number multiplication. Since the second operation is scaling, the number multipied is called **scalar**. 

***The essence of linear algebra lies in that its geometric intuition can be translated to its numeric representation.***
